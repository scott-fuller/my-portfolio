## Developer Portfolio
### Introduction

This is a portfolio page for Scott Fuller. Scott is a content management expert who dabbles in development and design. Please do not judge the site harshly. It is merely a simple tool to share some of my work. 


### Installation

See the step by step tutorial [on Medium] I used to set this up (https://medium.com/@evanca/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd).

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
